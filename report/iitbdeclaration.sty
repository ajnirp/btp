I declare that this written submission represents my ideas in my own words and where 
others' ideas or words have been included, I have adequately cited and referenced the original 
sources.  I also declare that I have adhered to all principles of academic honesty and integrity 
and   have   not   misrepresented   or   fabricated   or   falsified   any   idea/data/fact/source   in   my 
submission.  I understand that any violation of the above will be cause for disciplinary action 
by the Institute and can also evoke  penal action from the sources which have thus not been 
properly cited or from whom proper permission has not been taken when needed.\\
