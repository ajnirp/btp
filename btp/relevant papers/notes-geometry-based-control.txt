aim is to provide special effects with burning (possibly moving) objects, such as fire spreading in a desired pattern or a character running while on fire
basically we want to fire to spread and burn in a controlled manner, and rather than have an artist do it manually we want to geometrically control the fire spread
deformation does not seem to have been a strong focus
