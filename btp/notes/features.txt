Brief description and summary of the various physical models seen so far, with comparison of the features they support.

Driving Object Deformations from Internal Physical Processes

model large scale secondary effects in physical simulation e.g. deformation of burning object
deformation due to microscopic contraction of fibers

possible models for burning objects
	levelset methods
	remeshing
	neither addresses secondary deformations

free form deformation - points on the object are represented using an affine combination of the vertices of the encapsulating shape

proxy object choices - bounding box / convex hull / skeleton etc.

Problem - model secondary deformations
Idea - there is a physically based simulation guiding the primary deformations. Simplify this deformation to model deformations due to secondary effects

Level Set Method
----------------

type - Eulerian method

Fuel may be solid or gaseous. A flame consists of vaporized or solid fuel burning and giving hot gaseous products.
The bluish color comes from the chemical reaction of burning of the fuel.
The yellowish-orange color is the blackbody radiation emitted by the hot gaseous products.
The greyish-black color is the color of smoke or soot. At this point, the temperature of the hot gaseous products has dropped quite a bit.

An implicit surface separates the gaseous fuel from the hot gaseous products.

in both cases, fuel is converted into hot gaseous products
deflagrations
	low speed
	model as incompressible and inviscid flow
detonations
	high speed events
	shock-waves, compressible effects are important
	example - explosions
dynamic implicit surface to track reaction zone
model gaseous fuel and hot gaseous product separately using independent sets of incompressible flow equations
use mass and momentum balance along the reaction edge to couple these two separate equations
fire rendered as a participating medium
S = speed with which reacted fuel exits
The larger the value of S, the smaller the actual size of the blue core

for solid fuels, use the boundary of the object itself as a reaction front

level set method
	space without fuel +
	without fuel -
	reaction zone 0

use Navier Stokes equations

analysis
+ physically based and specific to fire
+ fairly accurate
+ nicely parametrizable
	can tweak values of S to get different blue core sizes
	can tweak expansion parameter to get different yellow color sizes
+ looks nice!

Modeling Fire using SPH
-----------------------

type - Langrangian (SPH is Langrangian)

extra particle properties (over and above mass, velocity, pressure, density, color, position, force) are
	burnable
	is_burning (bool)
	burning_time (time left to burn)

using burnable as particle color, calculate an average color field gradient
if CFG exceeds a threshold, set is_burning to true
decrease burning_time and check if burn should be off
now visualize burning particles

analsyis

+ simplified fire model
+ only a few extra parameters than regular fluid SPH
+ fast, due to the above reasons (my guess, not yet verified)
- ignores physical components of fire
- no relation to burning / deformation / destruction of materials

Interactive Simulation of Fire
------------------------------

type - Eulerian (N^3 voxels)

3-gas system - fuel gas, exhaust gas (includes smoke) and heat
Based on incompressible fluid dynamics equations on coarse grids
Use incompressible flow equations to avoid time step restriction
Coarse grids to neglect viscous effects
if temperature in a cell exceeds threshold, set it to burning
during ignition, set threshold to 0 (or increase temperature in cells to be burnt)

+ handles extinction of flame (all air used up), smoke
+ interactive
- doesn't look realistic (flame looks very smooth)
- doesn't simulate charring and decomposition of solids

Thin-Shell Object Burning
-------------------------

type - Eulerian

Thin-shell objects deform on burning
Deformation affects fire spread and vice versa
3 states - burning, burnt, unburnt
fire spreads from burning calls to adjacent cells
calculate ignition starting time of a cell as spreading time plus ignition starting time of initial point
fringe cell - a burning cell with at least one non-burning neighbour
free form deformation - enclose an object in a grid of vertices
associate lattice vertices with object vertices
bending and crumpling expressed by rotating adjacent vertices about the area where deformation is happening


Eulerian vs Lagrangian
----------------------

Eulerian

+ work well on gas flows
+ nonphysical oscillations near some material surfaces

Conversely, Lagrangian does well for multimaterial surfaces, not so good for gas flows

Ghost Fluid Method: Use an Eulerian scheme which treats the interface in a Lagrangian way

Idea: track the interface with a level set function
at the interface solve an approximate Riemann problem

Todo right now

Classes of objects
	membrane - paper, cloth
	solid - log (cylinder), cube
	gunpowder trail
	ropes, candle wicks
Generalised burning model?
Merge with flames?
Burning -> temperature rise -> burning (don't just graft the fire model and the burning model onto each other! Actually make the two depend on each other!)
