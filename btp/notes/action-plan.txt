model different objects
	should be of diff classes
	matchstick, candle, paper, rope, wood
	burn transfer
model flame
	flame progression
	burning
oxygen?

augmented mpm for phase change

effects of burning
	deformation
	mass loss
		heat - conducted in the solid - diffusion equation
		smoke - fluid
		ash - mpm
		melting - mpm

mesh
grid data structure - done
put mesh in grid - done, partially
OpenGL - done
use mantaflow for physically based modeling of fire - use solvers
put flame in grid
--end aug

solid and flame together
flame propagation + smoke, no deformation
--end sep

deformation, ash
multiple objects supported, flame transfer supported
--end oct


melting, raytracing via RenderMan - reads simulation state dumps

mantaflow grid

screenspace rendering of fluids curvature flow
screenspace rendering of fire?
