Meshing libraries

Meshlab - unstructured 3D triangular meshes
CGAL - heavy library for algorithms on meshes
VCGlib - building blocks for triangular and tetrahedral meshes
TetGen - tetrahedral mesh generator. takes as input .poly or .smesh files and outputs mesh files. looks the most promising so far.
